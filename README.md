# Thinning_skeleton
Thinning skeleton algorithm
I. Input: a binary image to be given.
 
	  // Use argv[0] for the input file

II. Outputs: 

      You should have two output files: // Use argv[2] and argv[3].

	- Use argv[1] to do:
  
		1) Create the skelton image from the final result of the thinning algorithm 
			with image header for future processing.

	- Use argv[2] for debugging: 
 
		2) Pretty print the input image.
			with proper caption.

		3) Pretty print the *third cycle* after each thinning direction (N, S, W, E) 
			with proper caption.

		4) Pretty print the *fifth cycle* (if not finish)
			after each thinning direction (N, S, W, E) 
			with proper caption.

		5) Pretty print the result of the thinning 
			with proper caption.
